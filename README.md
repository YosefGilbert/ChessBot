COP3530 - Project 3
This project serves to implement and compare two chess engines. One engine uses a minimax algorithm (tree traversal) with alpha-beta pruning to find the best possible move within a certain depth. The other chess engine takes an ML approach using tensorflow to find the best move.

How To Use
a) Choose to:

Play against the Minimax Algorithm Chess Engine 🧑‍💻

Play against the ML Chess Engine 🤖

Watch the Minimax and ML Chess Engines Play Against Each Other 📺

NOTE: If you selected option 1, you will also have to enter a depth. It is recommended that a depth of 1-5 be selected (see Limitations below).

b) In order to play against the ML or Minimax Algorithm Chess Engines, simply enter the position of the piece and the position you would like to move this piece to (long algebraic notation).

For Example: bc8bh3

Features ♛
♙ Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

♙ ML and Minimax Implementations

♙ TensorFlow for ML Implementation

Limitations ♙
♙ No current implementation of en passant nor castling

♙ Running this program at depth 1-5 is preferable as a depth >5 will take very long to run

NOTE: A run at depth = 5 will still take about 10 minutes per turn. For a faster playthrough, running the board at depth = 2 or 3 is recommended, though this will reduce the skill level of the engine's decision-making

♙ No GUI currently implemented
